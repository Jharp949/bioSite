        <p id="desc1">Ceramic art is art made from ceramic materials, including clay. It may take forms including artistic pottery, including tableware, tiles, figurines, and other sculpture. As one of the plastic arts, ceramic art is one of the visual arts. While some ceramics are considered fine art, such as pottery or sculpture, most are decorative, industrial, or applied art objects.</p>

        <p id="desc2">Baroque art originated in Italy in the late 1500's and continued to the 1740's. The term Baroque probably derives from the Portuguese word barueco, which means irregularly shaped pearl. Unlike the harmony and equilibrium of the Renaissance period, Baroque art is highly ornate and designed to evoke emotion in the observer. The styles and themes employed in Baroque art differ between northern and southern Europe due to the influence of the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation.</p>

        <p id="desc3">Jazz is a musical form that relies on improvisation and rhythmic urgency. Improvisation is a primary way that jazz musicians express themselves, requiring them to be inventive and create music on the spot. Such musical artists often do this by changing melodies rhythmically or embellishing the melody. The rhythm of jazz is often syncopated, which is when accents occur on the off-beat, and it may be polyrhythmic, which is when multiple, contrasting rhythms occur at the same time.</p>
